File description:

1. MathTerm - a class which represents the base class for all other sub classes
			   it also evaluates the latex representation in the following 
			   order: exponent, bar and then negation.
2. BinaryMathTerm - This class represents a term composed of exactly two 
			        independent math terms.
3. FractionMathTerm - This class represents a special case of binary math term. 
					  It rendered to be  as a fraction ("kav shever" in hebrew).
4. SimpleMathTerm - This class represents a math term which is either a 
					single letter variable (x,y,a,b,etc..)  or a number 
					(may be a floating point number).in case this term 
					represents a number, the class will allow to user 
					to control the precision of its latex representation.
5. SimpleOpMathTerm - This class represents a simple operation between two other 
					  terms. For example, "a+b", "c*d" or "c=d".
6. BracketsMathTerm - This class represents a math term between brackets.
7. SumMathTern - This class represents a mathematical sum. 
				It comprised of 3 MathTerms: 
 				- Term beneath the sigma sign.
				- Term above the sigma sign. 
				- Term being summed.
